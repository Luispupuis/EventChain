# EventChain
Easy-to-use event system

Originally developed by Luck @ https://github.com/lucko/helper - the event system from that library was split off and re-written to be more generic.

This event system allows for many different Minecraft plugin types (not just Bukkit) as well as the ability to create completely new and custom ones.

# Maven

Maven modules up soon!

# Usage

Usage can be found on Luck's repo here: https://github.com/lucko/helper/wiki/helper:-Events

The concept (and usage) is essentially the same with some minor tweaks which can be discovered simply by using your IDE's auto-complete.
